# Country traveler

A simple test just to list all countries in the world and showing them.

Everything consumed from the endpoint [`Rest Countries`](https://restcountries.eu/).

Getting started
=

Clone the project
```
git clone git@github.com:IgorMing/country-traveler.git
```

Now, just go to into the project folder, and let's install the dependencies
```
yarn
```

After that, we just need to initialize the application
```
yarn start
```

Finishing the bundle, you just need to run it on your emulator (or on your own device) pressing `a` to Android or `i` to iOS.

> Double check whether you have a phone connected or an emulator running

And... That's it!
